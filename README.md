**Build-LLVM-From-Scratch**
- Hello all llvm developers and fresher who want to learn LLVM.
- This repository will just give a keen idea of what is LLVM and its uses along with buildin process of it.

**About LLVM**
- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) abbrevation is Low Level Virtual Machine.LLVM is a framework which is used to developed new language and improve existing     one.
- It consist of tools which is helping industry in language creation,creating a compiler, transferring the output code to multiple platforms and           architectures along with generation of architecture-specific optimizations.
- LLVM also consist of libraries, and header files which are used in process of converting binaries in to intermediate representations and converts it     into object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and bitcode optimizer. It also contains basic regression tests.
- The main advatnage of the LLVM project is that it provide a [SSA-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form)  (static single     assignment) compilation strategy.</br>
